Question 1 of 4: How does the type of school effect ELs and LEP student's in 
meeting UC/CSU entrance requirements? Also how does this varry between 
ethnicities?

Rationale: This could help schools better understand the type of learing 
environment that is best for students who are ELs and LEP students?

Note: This utilizes the Met UC/CSU Grad Req' as the response and uses with the 
ELs/LEP indicator along with the indicator for Charter school or non Charter
School.

Question 2 of 4: What factors effect ELs and LEP students meeting admission 
requirements for UC/CSU?

Rationale: Having an understadnign of how the various factors effect ELs and
LEP Students could help schools and parents determine which type of learning
environment will best serve these students.

Note: This utilizes the Met UC/CSU Grad Req' as the response and uses with the 
ELs/LEP indicator along with the factors for Charter school or non Charter
School (district, county, etc).

Question 3 of 4: What are the odds that a specified student ethnicity will meet 
admission requirements compared to a 'White, not Hispanic' student?

Rationale: From the odds we can gain a better perspective on the success rates
of underserved/ underrepresented student populations compared to their 'White, 
not Hispanic' peers, and learn which student population need the most additional
support.

Note: This compares the odds ratio of Met UC/CSU Grad Req' (Rate) of 'White, not 
Hispanic' with the odds ratio of students of the other ethnic origins through
categorical analysis methods.

Question 4 of 4: What are the odds that a ELs/LEP student will meet admission 
requirements compared to non ELs/LEP student?

Rationale: From the odds we can gain a better perspective on the success rates
of ELs/LEP students compared to non ELs/LEP strudents to see just how much any
descrpencies in support impacts this student population.

Note: This compares the odds ratio of ELs/LEP students with the odds ratio of 
students of who are not ELs/LEP students through categorical analysis methods.
