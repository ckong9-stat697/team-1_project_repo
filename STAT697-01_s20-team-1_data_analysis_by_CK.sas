'Meaning that the course content Charter School may have differences compared to the non-Charter ones. Will it affect the fairness of entering State-Funded Universities after graduating from Charter School and non-Charter Schools?'

"According to the Education Commission of the States, Charter schools are semi-autonomous public schools that receive public funds. They operate under a written contract with a state, district or other entity (referred to as an authorizer or sponsor)."
;

footnote2 justify=left
"This contract â€“ or charter, details how the school will be organized and managed, what students will be expected to achieve, and how success will be measured."

/*
Note: This compares the column CharterSchool with Met UC/CSU Grad Req (Count). 
We can use paired test to compare the differences between Charter School and 
non-Charter School.

Limitations: For data rows with an asterisk (indicating the number of entry is 
less than 10 to protect the students) should be excluded since it doesn't 
showany true values. Also, we should compare the number of count instead of 
rate since when we calculate the number of students from the rate, it will show 
decimals which is impossible for number of counts.

Note: This compares the column ReportingCategory, Seal of Biliteracy (Count)

analysis methods to determine this.

Limitations: For data rows with an asterisk (indicating the number of entry is

any true values. Also, we should compare the number of count instead of rate 
since when we calculate the number of students from the rate, it will show 
decimals which is impossible for number of counts.

Methodology: We can use porc sort to find which ethnicity has the most number
of Biliteracy Rate to see how the ethnicity and language affects the graduate
rate.

Followup Steps: We should see the entries that without a numerical value as it 
doesn't contains a figure of the reporting category. We should filter it for 
more accurate result.

Note: In data set 3, elsch19 there is a column "LANGUAGE" which can be relate 
to the column "ReportingCategory" where the "ReportingCategory" in dataset 
acgr19 & acgr18 are the reported race/ethnicity and gender. We can use 
categorical data analysis methods to determine this.

Limitations: For data with column LANGUAGE marked as Other non-English 
languages (Column LC = 99) should be excluded since it doesn't show which type 
of languages they use and can not relate to the column ReportingCategory. We 
also exclude the data with Not Reported in the column ReportingCategory as it 
doesn't have any value for analysis.
