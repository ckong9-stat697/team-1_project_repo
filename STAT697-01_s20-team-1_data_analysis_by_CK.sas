'Rationale: Many charters are exempt from variety of laws and regulations affecting other public schools if they continue to meet the terms of their charters.". Meaning that the course content Charter School may have differences compared to the non-Charter ones. Will it affect the fairness of entering State-Funded Universities after graduating from Charter School and non-Charter Schools?'

footnote1 justify=left
"According to the Education Commission of the States, Charter schools are semi-autonomous public schools that receive public funds. They operate under a written contract with a state, district or other entity (referred to as an authorizer or sponsor). This contract â€“ or charter, details how the school will be organized and managed, what students will be expected to achieve, and how success will be measured."

/*
Note: This compares the column CharterSchool with Met UC/CSU Grad Req (Count). 
We can use paired test to compare the differences between Charter School and 
non-Charter School.

Limitations: For data rows with an asterisk (indicating the number of entry is 
less than 10 to protect the students) should be excluded since it doesn't 
showany true values. Also, we should compare the number of count instead of 
rate since when we calculate the number of students from the rate, it will show 
decimals which is impossible for number of counts.
